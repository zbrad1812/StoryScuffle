    <h4 className="about-paragraph"> Thank you so much for reading this and visiting my website :) 
    this is the very first website that I built all on my own (with 
    the help of some good programmer friends here and there) so please
    try to go a little easy on me ;)
    
    Also, this site is still very much under construction. I am learning more
    and more every day and I'm really looking to refactor and add a lot of features.
    I hope you have a good day!</h4>
