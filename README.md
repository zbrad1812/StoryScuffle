# USE GIT VERSION CONTROL AND BRANCHING 

## Features MVP 
- Index short stories 
- short story show page 
- new story form 
- new prompt form 
- index of prompts 
- ensure all stories are associated (optionally) with a prompt 
- Ensure that only signed in users can create new prompts or stories 


## Features non-mvp (prioritize api integration ideally)
- Add story "tags" (this will be meaty to accomplish on the backend, but is otherwise standard CRUD)
- Markdown support with something like Draft.js 
- Either reminder emails (actionmailer rails) or texts (twilio) reminding users to get in their hours every day 

- consider other fun features for readers
At this point, we will need to brainstorm how this app scales, and what other purposes it may provide. Whether or not that is helping writers stick to a writing schedule every day/week, or a place to collaborate and expand on stories written,etc
